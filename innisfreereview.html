            <span class="opening">I</span>'m a huge fan of
            <span class="opening-2">Innis-Free</span> and the products they have
            to offer <span class="gap"></span> but I must say I was sceptical
            about their nail polish range. It is true the ingredients are better
            for your nails than the traditional nail polishes you find on the
            shelf but a predominantly skin-care focused brand making nail
            polish? ehhhh. The brand claims it's a highly pigmented color which
            gives rich and intense colors to the nails in a single coat. It also
            claims its long-lasting to ensure long wear of vivid nail colors and
            finally there are triple-care ingredients for the health of nails
            consisting of a combination of calcium, argan oil and tangerine oil
            to provide nourishment to damaged nails.

        <h3>About the brand</h3>
        <hr class="opening-paragraph-decor" />
        <p>
          <span class="opening-2">Innis-Free</span> are a leading brand in
          sustainability and clean formulas. They've paved the way and
          revolutionised more ecofriendly products and packaging with their use
          of clean formulas and recycling initiatives.. The list goes on so head
          over to their page to read about their amazing climate efforts. They
          pride themselves on their natural ingredients derived from the island
          of Jeju and carved the idea of naturalism phrased as 'Natural Benefit
          from JEJU'. The brand discovered 12 ingredients from the island’s
          land, sea, water, trees and flowers. and their devotion to good
          quality ingredients represents the brand’s philosophy, which aims to
          present customers with a healthy form of beauty through natural
          products.

        <h3>How to use</h3>
        <hr class="opening-paragraph-decor" />
        <ul>
          <li>Ensure nails are clean and free of any other nail polish</li>
          <li>Apply a base coat and wait to dry</li>
          <li>Apply the nail polish and wait to dry</li>
          <li>Optional: add a protective top coat</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>First Impressions</h3>
        <hr class="opening-paragraph-decor" />
        <p>
          The polishes glide on nicely, although their claim that one coat is
          sufficient is not accurate. I found the first coat to be patchy and
          not very pigmented. (I had used a clear base coat from another brand).
          I needed three coats. The polish did dry qucikly which is great if
          your in a time pinch.
        </p>

        <p>
          The colour was nice and they have a vast array to choose from however
          I found that it chipped very quickly. Less than a day after I applied
          it. I wasn't very impressed by this but tried again and unfortunately
          the same thing happened. For me I'd say its a good product if you just
          want the colour for one evening but the longevity of it (which it
          claims is very long-lasting) is not there. One last thought on the
          ingredients, the brand states there is a combination of calcium, argon
          oil and tangerine oil. They are absolutely correct however they are
          right at the bottom of the ingredients list meaning they are the
          ingredients that have the least concentration in the formula. So bear
          that in mind if you do decide to buy.
