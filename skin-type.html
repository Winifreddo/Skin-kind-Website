        <span id="first-letter">F</span>un fact: There are approximately eight
        trillion beauty products on the market today, which can be bewildering
        to even the most seasoned skin-care hobbyist. The options are so
        overwhelming that it can feel like the only two options you have are
        either slathering the entire A-Z of skin-care products on your face at
        once (don’t do it), or shunning products entirely and living your life
        in a cave somewhere, a greasy, flaky, and carefree mess (maybe do it).

      <p class="intro-paragraph">
        But skin-care really doesn’t have to be that hard, as long as you know
        your skin type. Because once you figure out whether your face is dry,
        oily, combination, or “normal,” you can zero in on the exact product
        types, formulations, and ingredients that are specifically designed to
        make your skin look calmer, glowier, and all around happier. Seems like
        a good deal, right? Read on to find out your skin type..

        <p>
          If it’s…<b>tight</b>, <b>flaky</b>, or <b> uncomfortable</b>, you
          likely have <b>DRY</b> skin
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          "Dry skin means that your face can't protect itself as well as it
          should from the environment. When the skin is dry, it develops tiny
          cracks in the outer layer, interfering with its ability to maintain
          hydration properly," says dermatologist Joshua Zeichner. As such, when
          you have dry skin choosing the right products is incredibly important.
          But surprisingly, the ones you should be choosing may go against your
          natural instincts. Moisture is key right?? But what if some
          “moisturising” products actually begot dryness? Are you shocked now?
          Read on for some tips and tricks as well as helpful products for that
          pesky dryness.

      <div class="advice">
        <span class="first"> 01 Start the Day Off Right</span> Your morning prep
        is important to get your skin ready for the day! Individuals with dry
        skin types should aim to hydrate and protect their skin.
        <span id="dry-1"
          ><span class="first">02 Choose a Non-Foaming Cleanser</span> If
          there's one thing that hasn't changed about our skincare routines
          since childhood, it's starting the day with a fresh face—literally.
          Look for a gentle, non-foaming cleanser specifically made with
          hydrating ingredients. These products remove dirt and oil without
          disrupting the outer skin layer the way that some foaming cleansers
          do.</span
        ><span id="dry-2"
          ><span class="first">03 Choose a Light Moisturizer</span> When it
          comes to moisturizer shopping, look for light moisturizers that
          contain ingredients that can soften rough cells, pull in hydration,
          and form a protective seal over the surface of the skin such as
          hylauronic acid.</span
        ><span id="dry-3"
          ><span class="first">04 Protect Yourself with SPF</span> Look for
          sunscreens that, of course, help the skin lock in moisture. Rather
          than a straight sunscreen that you would use for the beach if you have
          dry skin, look for a moisturizer/sunscreen combo. Look for an SPF that
          is 30 or higher.</span

        <p>
          If it’s…<b>oily</b> in some places, <b>tight</b> in others, you likely
          have <b>COMBINATION</b> skin.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          Combination skin overproduces oil in some places and under-produces
          oil in others, giving you the most-frustrating sides of both worlds.
          But—and I’m about to blow your mind, here—you don’t have to use the
          same skin-care product over your entire face. WHAAAT. Yup! You can
          build a routine that utilizes oils and creams on your cheeks and jaw,
          for example, with lightweight serums and acne-treatments on just your
          forehead and nose, targeting each “problem area” with the correct
          products.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="advice">
        <span class="first"> 01 Cleansers can change with the seasons</span> The
        right cleanser depends on your unique type of combination skin, you may
        have more oiliness or more dryness as the seasons change. In general,
        look for a gentle cleanser and wash your face with lukewarm water both
        morning and night.<span id="combination-1"
          ><span class="first">02 Tone (Morning & Night)</span> A toner is
          essential for combination skin. Look for formulas designed to balance
          the skin—a safe bet is one that is both pH balanced and has hyaluronic
          acid, which will provide a much-needed boost of moisture but also help
          calm irritated skin.</span
        ><span id="combination-2"
          ><span class="first">03 Choose the right Moisturizer</span>
          Moisturizing is one of the most important steps for combination skin.
          Use a lightweight moisturizer in the morning and apply after cleansing
          and toning. At night, use a richer option that will renew skin while
          you sleep. Search for products with hyaluronic acid to help skin
          retain moisture.</span
        ><span id="combination-3"
          ><span class="first">04 Protect Yourself with SPF</span> Look for
          sunscreens that contain zinc oxide, this is a great ingredient for
          combination skin. Rather than a straight sunscreen that you would use
          for the beach if you have dry skin, look for a moisturizer/sunscreen
          combo. Look for an SPF that is 30 or higher.</span

        <h4 id="oily-skin">OILY SKIN</h4>
        <p>
          If it’s…<b>oily</b> or <b>shiny</b> all over, you likely have
          <b>OILY</b> skin.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          Oily skin overproduces sebum, and while that has its advantages
          (hello, fewer forehead wrinkles), it also has major drawbacks—namely
          looking and feeling oily. And as annoying as that can be for makeup,
          which tends to slip and slide on oily skin, it can also contribute to
          more acne and clogged pores, which means your routine should focus on
          regulating your sebum with light, water-based products, mattifying
          powders, and, if necessary, anti-acne treatments, all of which means…
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="advice">
        <span class="first">01 Stay away from these products</span> Since your
        oily skin is already producing too much of the good stuff, make sure to
        skip: Heavy facial oils, thick, oil-based creams , harsh scrubs or
        super-drying formulas, like charcoal masks and benzoyl peroxide (they’ll
        strip your skin, causing it to produce even more oil to
        compensate).<span id="oily-1">
          <span class="first"
            >02 Choose specific indgredients in your Cleanser</span
          >
          Use a gentle cleanser. If you need something stronger, look for
          ingredients specifically made for oily skin and acne, such as benzoyl
          peroxide, salicylic acid, glycolic acid, or beta-hydroxy acid.
          Although usually marketed for acne, these products work well for oily
          skin too. </span
        ><span id="oily-2"
          ><span class="first">03 Choose a Gel based Moisturizer</span> When it
          comes to moisturizer shopping, look for gel based moisturizers that
          are free of oils and release specific ingredients that attract water
          from deeper layers of skin and bring it to the skin’s surface.</span
        ><span id="oily-3"
          ><span class="first"> 04 Protect Yourself with SPF</span> Opt for an
          SPF that is free of oil. Rather than a straight sunscreen that you

        <h4 id="normal-skin">NORMAL SKIN</h4>
        <p>
          If it’s…pretty <b>comfortable</b> and not greasy, you likely have
          <b>NORMAL</b> skin.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          Welp, your skin produces just the right amount of sebum all over your
          face. Congratulations; you can now have a party with the eight other
          people in the world who also have normal skin. I’m sure you’ll all be
          very happy together. No, I’m not bitter. Since your skin can handle
          both dry- and oily-type products, you should instead build your
          routine around specific skin concerns you have, like aging, redness,
          or dullness.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="advice">
        <span class="first">01 Start the Day Off Right </span> Your morning prep
        is important to get your skin ready for the day! Individuals with dry
        skin types should aim to hydrate and protect their skin.<span
          id="normal-1"
          ><span class="first">02 Choose a Non-Foaming Cleanser</span> If
          there's one thing that hasn't changed about our skincare routines
          since childhood, it's starting the day with a fresh face—literally.
          Look for a gentle, non-foaming cleanser specifically made with
          hydrating ingredients. These products remove dirt and oil without
          disrupting the outer skin layer the way that some foaming cleansers
          do.</span
        ><span id="normal-2"
          ><span class="first">03 Choose a Light Moisturizer</span> When it
          comes to moisturizer shopping, look for light moisturizers that
          contain ingredients that can soften rough cells, pull in hydration,
          and form a protective seal over the surface of the skin such as
          hylauronic acid.</span
        ><span id="normal-3"
          ><span class="first"> 04 Protect Yourself with SPF</span> Look for
          sunscreens that, of course, help the skin lock in moisture. Rather
          than a straight sunscreen that you would use for the beach if you have
          dry skin, look for a moisturizer/sunscreen combo. Look for an SPF that
          is 30 or higher.</span
