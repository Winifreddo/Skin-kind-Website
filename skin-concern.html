      <div class="advice">
        <span class="first"> 01 What Causes Hyperpigmentation?</span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Sun damage</span>- Eeek, those pesky UV
          rays. The sun can cause hyperpigmentation in the form of age
          spots.</span
        ><span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Chloasma (Melasma)</span>- Patches of
          discoloration can be a side effect of hormonal changes.</span
        >
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Post-inflammation</span>- When skin goes
          through an iflammation (think acne/eczema) it can go into overdrive
          and produce darker spots as the healing process comes to an end.</span
        >
        <span class="concern"
          ><span class="sub-heading">Medical conditions</span>-
          Hyperpigmentation can be a symptom of an underlying medical condition
          such as Addison’s disease, if you are ever uncertain in these
          circumstances it is best to seek medical advice from your doctor or
          dermatologist.</span
        >

        <span class="second">02 How can you prevent hyperpigmentation</span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Avoid direct sunlight</span>- Hours between
          10am-2pm can be detremental to the condition of your skin as these
          arethe peak hours for the sun and its darn UV. If you are out use a
          hat to provide shade for your face.</span
        ><span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Vitamin C</span>- Vit C, is a game changer
          guys. With its antioxidising properties, it is known for its powerful
          skin-brightening and anti-ageing super powers that help to neutralise
          and limit sun damage.</span
        >
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Apply SPF</span>- You guessed it, golden
          rule numero uno! Slather that sunscreen on winter, spring summer and
          falll! you should be aiming for a 50++ strength and re-apply
          throughout the day.</span
        >

        <span class="second"> 03 Effective hyperpigmentation treatments</span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Niacinamide</span>- AKA Vitamin B3 is
          clinically proven to reduce appearance of hyperpigmentation and even
          skin tone. </span
        ><span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Retinol</span>- Woohoo one of our all time
          favs at skin kind! This ingredient helps speed up natural skin cell
          turnover meaning it helps reduce those unwanted dark spots. YAY for
          retinol!</span
        >
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Vitamin C</span>- Yes yes, we already
          mentioned Vitamin C but its so good we had to mention it twice. This
          wonderous ingredient will fade hyperpigmentation marks and give you a
          more even toned complexion.

        <h4 id="enlarged-pores">Enlarged Pores</h4>
        <p>
          If you have…<b>visible</b> pores on your face, you likely have
          <b>Enlarged pores</b>.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          Pores are the small openings on the skin that pass sweat and sebum out
          to the surface.. Kinda cool right? Enlarged pores refer to the pores
          that are more visible to the naked eye. A surprising fact is that
          enlarged pores are quite often genetic, Thanks ma and pa. But there
          are also factors such as sebum secretion and skin elasticity that may
          make pores larger due to oil combining with skin debris and causing
          clogging. You can tackle enlarged pores by targeting their undelying
          causes- i.e., the increased sebum secretion. Lets debunk a myth here
          “pores open and close” no, no, no my skin enthusiast children, it is
          impossible for pores to open and close on their own accord. They may
          however, dialte due to skin debris build up.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="advice">
        <span class="first"> 01 What Causes Enlarged Pores?</span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Excessive sebum secretion</span>- Eww,
          anyone else with me here? I kid of course, this is a totally natural
          process that we all go through. Unfortunately though, on occasion we
          may produce to much sebum especially on the nose area thanks to the
          sebaceous glands that are beneath the skin in this area. </span
        ><span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Not removing Makeup</span>-Uh-oh, I know we
          are all guilty of this fact, we had a long day and crashed, we got a
          little wild at the weekend and forgot to remove our makeup- it
          happens, no judgement here queens. But consistently not removing
          makeup ends in our pores becomming clogged and enlarged.
        </span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Skin Elasticity</span>- As we age collagen
          levels decrease resulting in pores losing their elasticity. What does
          that mean? It means elasticity gives our skin its plump healthy look,
          as this decreases the pores start to sag and engorge.
        </span>

        <span class="second"> 02 How can you prevent Enlarged pores?</span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Do the basic routine</span>- Cleanse, Tone
          and moisturize daily, Exfoliate 2-3 times weekly, and add a specific
          treatment to your routine i.e., anti-aging or anit-oil. </span
        ><span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Avoid certain products</span>- Thick/greasy
          creams, bar soap, harsh scrubs, dehydrating home treatments.. just do
          not do it. Check your ingredients and look for products that target
          pore reduction.
        </span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Apply SPF</span>- Yes queen! again with the
          SPF. You should be aiming for a 50++ strength and re-apply throughout
          the day..</span
        >

        <span class="second"> 03 Effective enlarged pore treatments</span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Collagen</span>- Your skin is hungry for the
          creme-de-la-creme of ingredients so feed it collagen, this will help
          with the skins natural collagen production and help to keep skin
          looking plump, bouncy and as fresh as the day you were born. </span
        ><span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Glycolic acid</span>- It is not as scary as
          it seems, a gently glycolic acid aka AHA will remove the top layer of
          the skin whilst simultaneously resurfacing working to regenerate skin
          cells and clear out pores.
        </span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Salicylic acid</span>- Aka BHA will act as
          an exfoliant and help to reduce sebum production making them less
          likely to become clogged and dilated.

        <p>
          If it's…starting to lose it's <b>bounce</b>, <b>plumpness</b> or
          <b>pizazz</b> you likely have <b>Ageing</b> skin.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          It's no secret that your skin changes as you age. Whether you notice
          loss of elasticity or volume, a few fine lines here and there, or
          discoloration where you didn't use to have it, these changes can be a
          bit stressful as you try to navigate a brand new skincare routine. The
          products that worked for you in your early 20s may lose its efficacy
          even as early as a few years later, and you constantly have to adjust
          your regimen based on your skin's current needs, does this sound like
          you? Couldn’t you just cream at the ever depleting quality... Well yes
          but we don’t need to. There are certain remedies and preventative
          measures we can take. Its never to late ladies and gentlemen to care
          for your skin.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="advice">
        <span class="first"> 01 What Causes Ageing?</span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Natural ageing of skin</span>- Okay guys,
          there is no denying our skin is naturally going to age with time, we
          need to face it and be okay with it. </span
        ><span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Sun exposure</span>- Remember the one
          billion times before we mentioned sunscreen?? This is a huge reason
          why sunscreen is so important. As we expose our skin to the sun and
          its ever encompassing UV rays we inadvertantly increase the ageing
          process. The UV rays increase the production of melanin which is a
          first defense but once that defence is exceeded our cells start
          killing themselves, mainly to prevent cancerous cells but a sad side
          effect is the ageing of the skin.. WEAR SUNSCREEN GUYS.
        </span>

        <span class="second">02 How can you prevent Ageing?</span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Limit sun exposure</span>- Self explanitory,
          once we over expose our skin it naturally reacts and speeds the ageing
          process.</span
        ><span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Quit smoking</span>- Bad news if you’re a
          smoker, much like sun exposure smoking speeds up the ageing process,
          plus you are wasting money on ageing faster when you could be spending
          it on skin-care.</span
        >
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Wash your face regularly</span>- When you
          leave makeup on your face over night, your skin absorbs most of it.
          Since most cosmetics contain harsh chemicals, this contributes to the
          oxidative stress your skin faces. That’s why taking an extra three to
          five minutes to wash your face at night is never a waste of
          time.</span
        >

        <span class="second"> 03 Effective Ageing treatments</span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Collagen</span>- Your skin is hungry for the
          creme-de-la-creme of ingredients so feed it collagen, this will help
          with the skins natural collagen production and help to keep skin
          looking plump, bouncy and as fresh as the day you were born. </span
        ><span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Retinoids</span>- Retinoids are considered
          to be the holy grail anti-aging ingredient, no joke. Retinoids are a
          vitamin A-derived molecule that work deeper in than collagen to help
          with collagen remodeling, as well as on the skin surface to increase
          skin cell turnover and improve discoloration and uneven skin tone.
        </span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Sunscreen</span>- No explanation needed
          here, i’m sure we’ve terrified you into incorporating sunscreen into
          your routine already.</span
        >
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Peptoids</span>- Ooh-la-la so fancy. These
          active ingredients are building blocks of protein and send signals to
          help build collagen and depending on the peptide, they can also send
          signals to improve moisturization in the skin.

        <h4 id="sensitivity">Sensitivity</h4>
        <p>
          If it's…<b>tight</b>, <b>flaky</b>, or <b>red</b>, you likely have
          <b>Sensitivity</b>.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          Sensitive skin is a condition that can be experienced by all the skin
          types- You may not show visible symptoms but instead notice how
          products feel on your skin.. “remembers the burning sensation of the
          pound shop charcoal face mask” Sensitivity can be just that, an
          uncomfortable sensation or it can be symptomatic (also known as
          hyper-sensitivity) resulting in rashes, redness, swelling and more.
          One thing, it can be hard to distinguish if you have dry skin or
          sensitive skin, as annoyingly the skin type and concern tend to
          co-exist unharmoneously meaning dry skin is often sensitive and
          sensitive skin is you guessed it often dry. Boo skin, just boo. Lets
          take a look at some causes and treatments.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="advice">
        <span class="first"> 01 What Causes Sensitivity?</span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Allergies</span>- When your skin has an
          allergic response, it means your immune system is in overdrive. When
          your skin comes into contact with an allergen, your body tries to
          protect itself by releasing T-cells. This process can lead to redness
          and itching. In these cases, if you have an allergic reaction pay
          attention to the ingredients in products, it will be a hit and miss
          whilst you try and work out where the reaction is coming from, you can
          try researching common allergies and start terminating these
          ingredients from your products. </span
        ><span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Dry skin</span>- It turns out the dry winter
          air may be enough to cause your skin sensitivity. According to the
          American Academy of Dermatology Association, excessively dry skin can
          put you at risk for developing another skin condition due to the
          irritation and itching. </span
        ><span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Underlying medical conditions</span>-
          Certain medications, especially ones that treat hypertension, can
          cause dehydration and thus dry, irritated skin. Hormonal changes, such
          as those during the menstrual cycle, can also affect the skin.
        </span>

        <span class="second">02 How can you prevent Sensitivity?</span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Rule out certain ingredients</span>- If you
          are having reactions symptomatic or not to certain ingredients opt for
          products that don’t carry these ingredients. As a rule, most sensitive
          skin cannot handle harsh fragrences that are in some products, opt for
          unscented. </span
        ><span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Hydration</span>- When skin is deydrated it
          can be a gateway to sensitivity as the skin cannot protect itself, opt
          for a moisturizer that creates a protective barrier over your skin and
          use morning and night.</span
        >

        <span class="second"> 03 Effective Sensitivity treatments</span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Hyalauronic acid</span>- Acid on sensitive
          skin? Are you crazy? Well yes but this is perfectly logical.
          Hyaluronic acid is a key ingredient that is naturally produced by
          skin. It’s a humectant with amazing capabilities, it can hold around
          50x its weight in water, so just imagine how much moisture it helps
          your skin retain! </span
        ><span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Vitamin E</span>- Vitamin E is an
          antioxidant, meaning that it defends your cells from free radicals and
          helps prevent cell damage. It’s also super moisturising and has been
          known to aid wound healing so this is for sure an active ingredient
          your sensitive skin will love!
        </span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Ceramides</span>- Ceramides are lipids that
          are naturally found in the outermost layer of the skin i.e. the
          epidermis. They basically act as the ‘glue’ between skin cells,
          forming a tight seal and helping protect against external
          contaminants. Ceramides are great at providing moisture, reducing
          signs of ageing and restoring the skin barrier. It also improves skin
          tone, making it feel more firm and plump.</span

        <p>
          If it's…If it’s…<b>bumpy</b> to the touch or <b>makeup</b> doesn’t sit
          well , you likely have <b>Textured</b> skin
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="intro">
        <p>
          Even though perfectly smooth, poreless skin is flat-out impossible
          (your pores serve a very important purpose in keeping your skin
          moisturized, y'all!), you can get pretty dang close with the right
          skin texture products and treatments, but you've gotta find out what's
          causing the texture first. How much time do you have? No, seriously,
          bumps on your skin could be so many different things, but typically,
          as we age, skin cell turnover (the shedding of dead skin cells) slows
          down, which can increase dullness and uneven skin texture. Your skin
          texture could also be bumpy from psoriasis, contact dermatitis,
          keratosis pilaris, or even acne scars and pockmarks. And, last but not
          least, the source of your texture could be the sun—i.e., the culprit
          behind most skin concerns, and for good reason.

      <div class="advice">
        <span class="first"> 01 What Causes Texture?</span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Sun Exposure (again..sigh)</span>- You're
          already aware of how sun exposure can mess with your skin tone
          (melasma, dark spots, blah blah.), but the same can also be said about
          its effect on your skin's texture. UVB rays cause the premature death
          of living skin cells, which can lead to increased skin roughness,
          while UVA rays increase pigment production that'll give your skin an
          overall mottled texture and skin tone. YAY </span
        ><span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Dead Skin Cells</span>-Uneven skin texture
          is commonly a result of excess dead skin cells that build up on the
          surface of the skin. This can make areas of the skin feel rough or
          bumpy to the touch and can also give the skin a dull appearance.
        </span>

        <span class="second">02 How can you prevent Texture?</span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Stay hydrated</span>- Drink plenty of water
          as the moisture helps to make skin look and feel smoother. Moisturized
          skin also tends to lessen the appearance of dullness, which is a
          common symptom of uneven texture. </span
        ><span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Sunscreen baby</span>- We know this
          guys!</span
        >

        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Exfoliate</span>- It’s important to wash
          away those dead skin cells x2-3 per week with an exfoliant, which can
          be done either with a sonic brush or an everyday washcloth. The key is
          to find an exfoliant that isn’t too harsh on your skin since abrasive
          exfoliants can cause micro-tears and excess oil production.</span
        >
        <span class="second"> 03 Effective Texture treatments</span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Vitamin C</span>- Vitamin C is i’m saying
          it- a must-have ingredient for protecting your skin against the free
          radicals in the environment that lead to uneven skin. It also boosts
          brightness whilst also reducing the appearance of fine lines. </span
        ><span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading">Hyaluronic Acid</span>-Moisture will keep
          your skin looking even and whilst binding to collagen to replenish and
          strengthen the skin barrier and increase cellular turnover. This
          process helps remove dead, dehydrating skin cells more quickly to
          prevent clogged pores and dry, flaky patches while helping smooth out
          fine lines or wrinkles for firmer, more supple skin.
        </span>
        <span class="concern">
          <span class="sub-heading"> Calendula Oil</span>- extracted from
          marigold flowers, is an essential oil known for its anti-inflammatory
          and protective properties to treat common skin issues that cause
          textured skin. It contains antioxidant-rich flavonoids and saponins to
          boost your immune system, skin hydration, and stimulate collagen
          production. Collagen production increases cellular turnover to
          exfoliate any dry patches and cleanse pores for a more even skin
          texture. These anti-inflammatory benefits of calendula oil can reduce
          acne, allergic reactions, rashes, and symptoms associated with chronic
          skin conditions, like eczema and psoriasis. Calming these symptoms can
          help reduce any bumpy skin texture.</span
